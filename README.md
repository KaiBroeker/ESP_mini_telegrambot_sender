# ESP_mini_telegrambot_sender
This repi contains a minimalistic programm to send a telegram message to one device/client using the telegram bot api.  
I wrote the code some time ago to get a notification if a reed contact was closed.  
The code is as simple as possible and don't need additional library.

## How to use:
First you have to create a telegram bot. Follow this (tutorial from telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and it should work.  
After this you have to find the chat_id of your phone. There are any ways to get the id. For example you can use this [tutorial on medium.com](https://medium.com/@sean_bradley/get-telegram-chat-id-80b575520659)  
Now you can replace the placeholder in the source code.  
Finally you should change the chat message (text=). The message must be encoded. You can use this [online encoder for example](https://www.urlencoder.org/)
